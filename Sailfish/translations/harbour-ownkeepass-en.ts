        <source>On this page you can create a new database where ownKeepass will store your sensitive data.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Open the file browser and choose a file name and a directory. You can choose to locate your database in device memory, on the SD card or in the Android Storage. If the SD card entry is grey then no SD card is inserted or the card is not correctly detected by the System. There should be only one formatted partition on the SD card. Currently multi-partition SD cards are not supported by ownKeepass. &quot;Android storage&quot; is there to share the database with Android Apps. However sharing files with the Android world can be annoying due to different file ownership and permissions. Please be aware of that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Advice: If you upload your Keepass database into the cloud please make sure you use a locally stored key file in addition to the master password. This key file should not be uploaded to the cloud service.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use key file&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A key file can be used additionally to a master password to protect the Keepass database. Both are used together to generate a pass key which will open the database. So by using a file with lots of data inside the generated pass key becomes in principle stronger against attacks. You can use for example a random picture as key file.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Master password&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here goes the password for your new Keepass database. Please make sure you choose a long password of around 10 - 15 characters and use a mixture of small and big letters, numbers and special characters. Repeat the password in the &quot;Confirm Password&quot; field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</source>

Please note that if you forgot your master password there is no way to recover the password.

Furhtermore make sure you choose a long password of around 10 - 15 characters and use a mixture of small and big letters, numbers and special characters.

This value controls the amount of encryption rounds computed on the master password. Adjusting this value has direct effect on the time needed to decrypt the database on loading.

        <source>ownKeepass is a password safe application with the purpose to protect sensible data like passwords for web pages, credit card numbers, PINs, TANs and other bits of information which should be kept secret. All that information is saved in a database file which is encrypted and stored locally on your phone. To open the database you need to know the master password of the database. The used database format is compatible to Keepass version 1. That means you can use Keepass [1] on your desktop system to decrypt and open that database file, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please note that currently ownKeepass cannot load or save Keepass version 2 databases. This is planned for a future release of ownKeepass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Usage of help pages&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each page inside of ownKeepass has its own Help content. So please make use of it and learn about the features offered by ownKeepass especially on the settings pages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some words about Keepass database security&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The database code in ownKeepass is based on the KeepassX project [2] and as such contains a lot of security related features. It uses proven encryption algorithms like Advanced Encryption Standard (AES / Rijndael) or Twofish with 128 bits block size and 256 bits key size, SHA-256 as hashing algorithm and in-memory encryption of all passwords. Furthermore it protects the master password against Brute-Force and Dictonary Attacks by hashing and encrypting it before using it to decrypt the Keepass database. This feature is called key transformation rounds and can be adjusted in database settings. Anyway that all just adds additional security to two points which you should be aware of: &lt;br&gt;(1) Always use a long enough and difficult to guess master password.&lt;br&gt;(2) Protect your system from spyware which might be specialized to attack ownKeepass. The second is law #1 of the 10 Immutable Laws of Security [3]: &quot;If a bad guy can persuade you to run his program on your computer, it&apos;s not your computer anymore&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sharing Keepass database between your Jolla phone and your desktop PC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Keepass database file format is perfect to share your password safe between different systems like phones, tablets, desktop PC and so on. That is because there are a lot of Keepass implementations available for those platforms. Have a look at the Keepass download page [4] to get the classic Keepass 1 version for the desktop PC. There is also a list of alternative Keepass implementations on that page. I would also like to point you to KeepassX version 0.4.3 [2] which is also compatible with Keepass version 1.&lt;br&gt;You can share your Keepass database file via SD card or via a cloud service like Dropbox. When using a cloud server I would recommend to use a key file in addition to the master password. The additional key file will be used by ownKeepass to decrypt the database. Store this key file only locally on your phone and on your desktop PC. Do not upload it to the cloud service. If an attacker hacks your cloud service he will be left without the key file. By doing so you make it even harder for an attacker to crack your Keepass database because the key file content is usually impossible to guess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;What to expect in future versions of ownKeepass&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&apos;t want to set it in stone yet but here is a list of features you might see in future versions of ownKeepass:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Built-in sync of database file with a WebDAV server like ownCloud&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If feasible auto-type of username and passwords into web page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support for Keepass version 2 database files&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[1] &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keepass.info&quot;&gt;www.keepass.info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;[2] &lt;a href=&quot;www.keepassx.org&quot;&gt;www.keepassX.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;[3] &lt;a href=&quot;http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc722487.aspx&quot;&gt;10 Immutable Laws of Security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;[4] &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keepass.info/download.html&quot;&gt;www.keepass.info/download.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</source>

The used database format is compatible to Keepass version 1. That means you can use Keepass [1] on your desktop system to decrypt and open that database file, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please note that currently ownKeepass cannot load or save Keepass version 2 databases. This is planned for a future release of ownKeepass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Usage of help pages&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each page inside of ownKeepass has its own Help content. So please make use of it and learn about the features offered by ownKeepass especially on the settings pages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some words about Keepass database security&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The database code in ownKeepass is based on the KeepassX project [2] and as such contains a lot of security related features. It uses proven encryption algorithms like Advanced Encryption Standard (AES / Rijndael) or Twofish with 128 bits block size and 256 bits key size, SHA-256 as hashing algorithm and in-memory encryption of all passwords. Furthermore it protects the master password against Brute-Force and Dictonary Attacks by hashing and encrypting it before using it to decrypt the Keepass database. This feature is called key transformation rounds and can be adjusted in database settings. Anyway that all just adds additional security to two points which you should be aware of: &lt;br&gt;(1) Always use a long enough and difficult to guess master password.&lt;br&gt;(2) Protect your system from spyware which might be specialized to attack ownKeepass. The second is law #1 of the 10 Immutable Laws of Security [3]: &quot;If a bad guy can persuade you to run his program on your computer, it&apos;s not your computer anymore&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sharing Keepass database between your Jolla phone and your desktop PC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Keepass database file format is perfect to share your password safe between different systems like phones, tablets, desktop PC and so on. That is because there are a lot of Keepass implementations available for those platforms. Have a look at the Keepass download page [4] to get the classic Keepass 1 version for the desktop PC. There is also a list of alternative Keepass implementations on that page. I would also like to point you to KeepassX version 0.4.3 [2] which is also compatible with Keepass version 1.&lt;br&gt;You can share your Keepass database file via SD card or via a cloud service like Dropbox. When using a cloud server I would recommend to use a key file in addition to the master password. The additional key file will be used by ownKeepass to decrypt the database. Store this key file only locally on your phone and on your desktop PC. Do not upload it to the cloud service. If an attacker hacks your cloud service he will be left without the key file. By doing so you make it even harder for an attacker to crack your Keepass database because the key file content is usually impossible to guess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;What to expect in future versions of ownKeepass&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&apos;t want to set it in stone yet but here is a list of features you might see in future versions of ownKeepass:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Built-in sync of database file with a WebDAV server like ownCloud&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If feasible auto-type of username and passwords into web page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support for Keepass version 2 database files&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[1] &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keepass.info&quot;&gt;www.keepass.info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;[2] &lt;a href=&quot;www.keepassx.org&quot;&gt;www.keepassX.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;[3] &lt;a href=&quot;http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc722487.aspx&quot;&gt;10 Immutable Laws of Security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;[4] &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keepass.info/download.html&quot;&gt;www.keepass.info/download.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</translation>

        <source>This page is showing main password groups of your Keepass database. A password group is a container for password entries. Thus in order to store a password entry you need to create at least one group first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can use main password groups to organize your password entries. For example create groups for &quot;Online shops&quot;, &quot;Email Accounts&quot;, &quot;Social media pages&quot;, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A search bar can be enabled from pulley menu which is shown on top of the password group list. With it you can search for password entries throughout the whole Keepass database. If you want that the search bar automatically gets focus when you open the Keepass database please open the setting page and check the corresponding switch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</source>

The encryption algorithm can be changed also later after creation of your database in the database settings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set the default value for key transformation rounds for a new Keepass database. This value controls the amount of encryption rounds computed on the master password. Adjusting this value has direct effect on the time needed to decrypt the database on loading. But setting this value higher makes the database more robust against brute force attacks. As a good compromise between security and usability you should adjust the value so that opening the database takes one second on your phone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Security&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The inactivity lock time value is used to automatically lock the Keepass database after the specified amount of time has elapsed after the ownKeepass application went in background. Thus the inactivity timer is also active when ownKeepass is minimized to the cover state on home screen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fast unlock lets you use a strong master password and still allows quick access to your Keepass database. When you first open your password safe you are asked for your full password. But after you subsequently lock it you can unlock quickly with a partial password which consists of the first 3 characters of the master password. You can choose the number of wrong attempts from zero to 5 after which the database will be closed and the full master password is needed again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can enable clearing of the clipboard 10 seconds after you copied the username or password into it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;UI settings&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want to see username and password of all password entries already in the list views you can switch &quot;Extended list view&quot; on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By enabling &quot;Focus search bar&quot; the search bar on the master password groups page will be automatically focused and the on-screen keyboard is shown when you open the Keepass database.
